\chapter{Will the Democrats gain control of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections?}

\section{The Senate}
\label{sec:thesenategeneral}
\subsection{Starting position}

\newthought{The situation} is as follows:
\medskip

\begin{tabular}{ l | r | r || r | }
   now & Dem & Rep & Total \\
  \hline
  seats & 49 & 51 & 100 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\bigskip
The important element in the Senate elections is that the number of seats up for election is only a third (34) of the total Senate seats. Compared to the 435 seats which are up for election in the House this is a very small number.
Additionaly the seats up for election are not distributed evenly between the two parties: 26 democratic (2 independents included) seats are in contention but only 8 republican. To get a majority in the Senats the Democrats have to hold onto the 26 they have AND gain an extra 2 seats to get to 28 in this election.

\begin{itemize}
  \item They must hold onto their seats in states that Trump won. In 5 of those states (West-Virginia, North Dakota, Missouri, Montana and Indiana) he won with more than 10\% difference.
  \item They need to get at least two and preferably three in the group Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas.
  \item Health problems (McCain) could conceivably cause extra special elections
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The micro view: the State level}
\label{subsec:senate_micro}
\newthought{The Senate seems to be the hardest} to win for the Democrats. Nate Silver suggested\sidenote{''Are Democrats' Senate Chances in 2018 Overrated?" | Five Thirty Eight} a detailed method to calculate the probabilities of a win (or loss) \emph{on the State level}. The result of a simulation (N=10.000) based on the interpretation by Nate Silver of the probabilities of ''Safe"=0.95, ''Likely"=0.85, ''Lean"=0.75, ''Tilt"=0.60 (not included in the article) and ''Toss up"=0.50 is given in Figure~\ref{fig:senatesim}.

From this simulations we can see that the Democrats will (only) win \Sexpr{round(mean(race.senate.result),0)} seats, which is a loss of \Sexpr{26 - round(mean(race.senate.result),0)} seats! The probability of winning at least 28 seats is only \Sexpr{100*round(prob,2)} \%.

\subsection{The macro view: taking correlation into account}
\label{subsec:senate_macro}
Nate Silver argues that calculating state by state assumes that each state is run in a ''vacuum", completely independent of all others. However, the races are interconnected by factors that supersede the state level. 

\newthought{The approval rating of the president} is historically linked with the net number of seats won (positive) or lost (negative). This is clearly a factor that is above the state level and influences the total number of seats (not a particular one).

                     y = round(mean(midterm$Gain.Senate),1),
                     mean.loss = factor(round(mean(midterm$Gain.Senate), 1)))

We plot the net gain (+) or net loss (-) of Senate seats of the president's party in relation to the approval rate of the president and fit a linear model through all these points (Figure~\ref{fig:midterm.senate1}). The $R^{2}$-value is \Sexpr{round(summary(modall.senate)$r.squared,2)}. That is not very impressive.

A model for \emph{first term} presidents is better (Figure~\ref{fig:midterm1_senate_lm}) with an $R^{2}$-value of \Sexpr{round(summary(modterm1)$r.squared,2)}. That is better, but not great.
\medskip

The important observation in the Senate election is that the asymmetry in the seats which are up for election plays an important role. For example: in 2018 there are 26 democratic seats (independents included) up for election, but only 8 republican seats. I define the ''Seats up ratio" as the number of seats up for election of \emph{the president's party} devided by the number of seats up for election \emph{of the other party/parties}. In 2018 this is $\frac{8}{26}=0.308$. Of all midterm elections since 1946 this is the \emph{lowest} ratio!

<<echo=FALSE>>=
midterm1 %>% filter(Seats.up.ratio <= 1) -> midterm1low
modterm1low <- lm(Gain.Senate ~ Approval, data=midterm1low)
@
\newpage
The ''Seats up ratio" has an important influence. When we look at gains (+) or losses (-) of Senate seats in all midterm elections since 1946 for first term presidents when the president's party had to defend \emph{less} seats than the other party (which means that the ''Seats up ratio" is smaller than 1) there is \emph{no correlation} between the president's approval rate and the net result of the Senate race (Figure~\ref{fig:midterm1low_senate_lm}). The $R^{2}$-value is \Sexpr{round(summary(modterm1low)$r.squared,2)} which means that \emph{the approval rate of the president is not correlated with the net result of the Senate election}.

When we look at midterm elections for the Senate when the ''Seats up ratio" is greater than 1 (the president's party has to defend more seats than the other party) the situation is completely different (Figure~\ref{fig:midterm1high_senate_lm}).The $R^{2}$-value is now \Sexpr{round(summary(modterm1high)$r.squared,2)}. In this situation the president's approval rate is \emph{very} important.

\newthought{The generic ballot polls} could also give an indication of the more general feeling among the population. This also rises above the State level and could play a part. First investigations based on numbers given by The Times\sidenote{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/upshot/democrats-2018-congressional-elections-polling.html} do not seem to support this however. Further inquiry necessary.

\subsection{Connecting the micro and the macro}
\label{subsec:senata_micro_macro}
\newthought{The 2018 Senate election} has a \emph{first time president} who has the luxury that the number of seats up for election of his own party is \emph{the lowest} compared with the ''opposition" since 1946. He should not worry too much about his approval rate because it probably will not change the distribution of seats in the Senate. A zero net gain/loss means that the Democrats could hold onto their 26 seats (independents included), which is higher than what the micro level simulation predicts. The chance of maintaining the status quo is therefore possible because Figure~\ref{fig:midterm1low_senate_lm} shows that on average there is a net loss of 2 seats for the president's party. However: this should be interpreted very cautiously because the data set (first time presidents + Seats up ratio >=1) has only 5 data points.

Can the Democrats get to 28 seats? It is not impossible, but for the moment very unlikely.

\newthought{Conclusion} I do not see any reason to put the probability for \emph{a Democratic win of the Senate} higher than \textbf{20\%}.

\subsection{The micro view: the State level}
\newthought{The New York Times} gave on Feb. 7th 2018 a list of all the districts and their status as being ''Solid Dem", ''Lean Dem" etc. The result of a simulation (N=10.000) based on the same evaluations of the probabilities for ''Safe"=0.95, ''Likely"=0.85, ''Lean"=0.75, ''Tilt"=0.60 (not included in the article) and ''Toss up"=0.50 is (Figure~\ref{fig:housesim}).

Starting from the data per state, the Democrats are likely to \emph{win} 17 seats, getting them to 210. That is close to 218 in order to win the House, but not there yet. The probability to do so is \emph{about 5\%}.

\subsection{The macro view}
\label{subsec:macrohouse}

\newthought{For the House elections} there is a much stronger correlation between the number of seats \emph{gained} or \emph{lost} in a midterm election and the approval rate of the president\sidenote[][-2cm]{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07545.pdf} than for the Senate. I have redone the calculation from this paper, including the 2014 result, a correction of the 1950 approval rating of Truman, and adding the disapproval rating and the term of the election.

As in the case of the Senate a model based only on \emph{first term}-presidents is better (Figure~\ref{fig:midterm1house_lm}). The $R^{2}$-value is \Sexpr{round(summary(modterm1)$r.squared,2)}. That is much better.

The confidence interval is large: -38 to -64 seats. However: as the Republicans can only afford a loss of 25 seats, the probability that the Democrats take the House seems high.

The easiest way is to link the macro (the approval rate of the president) with the micro (the likelihood of a win by the Democratic candidate in a specific election), is to take the probability on the micro level, and increase it \emph{when the approval rate is below 60}. The limit of 60 comes from Figure~\ref{fig:midterm1house_lm}. It is the approval rate where the president's party does not lose any house seats. The degree of the upgrade will then depend on the difference between the actual approval rate and the limit of 60. Let us try an upgrade with one level: a ''Likely D" on the micro level becomes a ''Safe D" on the combined micro-macro level. This is equivalent of an increase of the probability of a democratic win with 10\%. 

The results of this upgrade are given in Figure~\ref{fig:housesimfull}. The Democrats get 245 seats which is more than enough to win the House. The calculated probability for a democratic win of the House in this case is \Sexpr{round(100*prob.House,2)}\%.

Perhaps an upgrade of 10\% is excessive. Let's look at a more moderate upgrade of half a level (+5\%) (Figure~\ref{fig:housesimhalf}). The Democrats could get 230 seats and easily win the House. The calculated probability for a democratic win of the House in this case is \Sexpr{round(100*prob.House,2)}\%.

\newthought{Conclusion}. The result of the upgrade and the prediction of the number of seats won by the model based on the approval rating point in the same direction. This is not surprising: because all 435 seats are up for election, a small ''general" effect will work on all those seats shifting the result in favor of the Democrats. Winning the House seems much more likely! Only a small ''macro" push will give the Democrats a majority in the House. However: this model is very volatile: a change from 0\% macro influence to 5\% shifts the number of seats from 210 to 230. I will work with a moderate 3\% macro influence. I put the probability of the Democrats winning the House for the moment at 75\%.

\chapter{Filling out the matrix}

We are not asked to give the probabilities for the winning of the Senate or the House, but for combinations of these two.

\section{About graphs, tables and many solutions}

\newthought{Ken Barns} posted a comment in the Good Judgement Open. In it he discussed a way to calculate the probability that e.g. the Democrats would win both the House and the Senate. He used the concept of the \emph{Likelihood Ratio}. I must admit I was not familiar with this. But it is linked to \emph{conditional probabilities}, and I got intrigued. However: it soon became clear that things are not so easy. I cannot put all the material I found on the subject in this document because it would become too long. I have put everything in another document called ''Conditional Probabilities and Likelihood Ratio". The matrix we are trying to fill out is aptly called the ''Confusion Matrix"! I will make the document available later. The mathematics are not difficult in themselves (mostly just fraction), but the matter becomes rather overwhelming.

\section{What are the conclusions about the matrix?} 

First: the starting data are crucial. Usually we start with the probabilities of a win for the Democrats in the Senate and in the House as a given. We take these probabilities from worthies like Nate Silver, or our own calculations. Then we try to find the probabilities of the combinations. 

Second: starting with the base probabilities of a House win and a Senate win is not necessary the best approach. You absolutely need one of these (a House win OR a Senate win) to start with. But once you have chosen that one (for example: probability of a win of the House for the Democrats = $P[H_{Dem}]=70\%$), other starting positions are possible. For example you can also start with two of the eight conditional probabilities, or one conditional probability and a Likelihood Ratio etc. At the moment this leads me to my forecast of \ref{sec:20180217}.

  \item Yes, both chambers: $P[S_{Dem}$  AND  $H_{Dem}]=P[S_{Dem}]*P[H_{Dem}]=0.5*0.6=0.3$

\end{itemize}

\section{2018-01-13}
\label{sec:Forecast2}

An excellent analysis of the situation at this moment by Nate Silver (\url{https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-democrats-senate-chances-overrated/}) on the chances the Democrats have of winning the Senate. He puts the probability $P[S_{Dem}]$ between 35\% and 40\%. Keeping the probability that the Democrats win the House on 60\%, I get Table~\ref{tab:Forecast2}. I used an ''independent" cross calculation because Nate Silver has already taken into account some degree of dependency.

\begin{margintable}[0cm]

\textbf{Forecast 2}:

  \item Yes, the Senate, but not the House: $P[S_{Dem}$  AND  $H_{Rep}]=P[S_{Dem}]*P[H_{Rep}]=0.15$

  \item No: $P[S_{Rep}$  AND  $H_{Rep}]=P[S_{Rep}]*P[H_{Rep}]=0.25$
\end{itemize}

\section{2018-01-24}
\label{sec:using_cond_prob}
After further development of section \ref{sec:conditional_prob} on ''Conditional Probabilities", we can now use the idea of \emph{partial dependency}. Let's start with the probabilities based on the article by Nate Silver cited in section \ref{sec:Forecast2}, and from these calculate the ''completely independent" scenario  (Table~\ref{tab:using_cond_proba}).

\begin{margintable}[0cm]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ l | r | r || r | }
    & $S_{Dem}$ & $S_{Rep}$ & Sum \\
  \hline
  \hline
  $H_{Dem}$ & 0.225 & 0.375 & $a=0.60$ \\
  $H_{Rep}$ & 0.150 & 0.250 & $(1-a)=0.40$ \\
  \hline
  \hline
  Sum & $b=0.375$ & $(1-b)=0.625$ & 1 \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Forecast 3: independent solution}
\label{tab:using_cond_proba}
\end{margintable}

We can see that $a > b$ and $(a+b)>1$. From \ref{subsec:limits} it follows that only two completely dependent solutions are mathematically possible: $P[H_{Dem}|S_{Dem}]=1$ and $P[H_{Rep}|S_{Dem}]=1$. These assumptions lead to one ''upward" table (Table~\ref{tab:using_cond_probb}) and one ''downward" table (Table~\ref{tab:using_cond_probc}).

\begin{margintable}[0cm]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ l | r | r || r | }
    & $S_{Dem}$ & $S_{Rep}$ & Sum \\
  \hline
  \hline
  $H_{Dem}$ & 0.375 & 0.225 & 0.600 \\
  $H_{Rep}$ & 0.000 & 0.400 & 0.400 \\
  \hline
  \hline
  Sum & 0.375 & 0.625 & 1 \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Forecast 3: 100\% upward dependent solution}
\label{tab:using_cond_probb}
\end{margintable}

\begin{margintable}[0cm]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ l | r | r || r | }
    & $S_{Dem}$ & $S_{Rep}$ & Sum \\
  \hline
  \hline
  $H_{Dem}$ & 0.000 & 0.600 & 0.600 \\
  $H_{Rep}$ & 0.375 & 0.025 & 0.400 \\
  \hline
  \hline
  Sum & 0.375 & 0.625 & 1 \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Forecast 3: 100\% downward dependent solution}
\label{tab:using_cond_probc}
\end{margintable}

Assuming an \emph{upward partial dependency} between $S_{Dem}$ and $H_{Dem}$ of 30\%, the value in the top left corner will be $0.225 + 0.3*(0.375 - 0.225)=0.27$. This gives us Tabel~\ref{tab:using_cond_probd}.

\begin{margintable}[0cm]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ l | r | r || r | }
    & $S_{Dem}$ & $S_{Rep}$ & Sum \\
  \hline
  \hline
  $H_{Dem}$ & 0.270 & 0.330 & 0.600 \\
  $H_{Rep}$ & 0.105 & 0.295 & 0.400 \\
  \hline
  \hline
  Sum & 0.375 & 0.625 & 1 \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Forecast 3: 30\% upward dependent solution}
\label{tab:using_cond_probd}
\end{margintable}

In essence we only need to know three numbers:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $P[H_{Dem}]$
  \item $P[S_{Dem}]$
  \item percentage of dependency
\end{enumerate}

All the rest follow from these three.

Not yet ready for a new Forecast.

\section{2018-02-01}

Gallup  presented the poll results of the approval/disapproval rate for Trump by state\sidenote{\url{http://news.gallup.com/poll/226454/trump-approval-highest-west-virginia-lowest-vermont.aspx?utm_source=alert&utm_medium=email&utm_content=morelink&utm_campaign=syndication}}. When I use only those states where there will be elections for the Senate, we get the following graph of the relation between the perceived probability of a democratic win (\ref{sec:thesenategeneral}) and the approval rate for Trump, by state.

There are a few odd ones:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Indiana and Missouri for the Democrats. These seem to be a little low.
  \item Arizona and Nevada for the Republicans. These seem to be a little high.
  \item Mississippi and Nebraska for the Republicans. These seem to be very low.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indiana}
Big lead (18,91\%) for Trump (56,82\%) vs. Clinton (37,91\%) in the 2016 election
\subsection{Missouri}
Big lead (18,63\%) for Trump (56,77\%) vs. Clinton (38,14\%) in the 2016 election
Probably McCaskill vs. Hawley. The latest poll (jan 8-9 2018) gives McCaskill a slight advantage (48/45). A ''Toss-up" still seems to be the right interpretation.
\subsection{Arizona}
Trump (48,67\%) had a small lead over Clinton (45,13\%)in the 2016 election
\subsection{Nevada}
Clinton (47,92\%) had a small lead over Trump (45,50\%) in the 2016 election
\subsection{Mississipi}
Big lead (17,83\%) for Trump (57,94\%) vs. Clinton (40,11\%) in the 2016 election
\subsection{Nebraska}
Huge lead (25,05\%) for Trump (58,75\%) vs. Clinton (33,70\%) in the 2016 election

\section{2018-02-23}

I am including two other GJO questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Which party will hold a majority in the US Senate after the 2018 midterm elections?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 53 senators or more
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 53 senators
    \item Republican Party, with 53 senators or more
    \item Republican Party, with less than 53 senators
  \end{itemize}
  \item Which party will hold a majority in the US House of Representatives after the 2018 midterm elections? Possible answers:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 230 or more representatives
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 230 representatives
    \item Republican Party, with 230 or more representatives
    \item Republican Party, with less than 230 representatives
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\newthought{Senate question}. The simulation (\ref{subsec:senate_micro}) shows a near normal distribution with mean=23 and standard deviation=1.75. The micro-macro effect (\ref{subsec:senata_micro_macro}) would keep them at 49 seats. 
The chances that
\begin{itemize}
  \item for the Democrats to have a majority of 53 and more means they need to win at least 4 extra seats. In the micro simulation (mean=23) that would mean 27 or more. The probability for that is \Sexpr{100*sum(race.senate.result>26)/N}\%
  \item the probability that the Democrats have a majority less than 53 (51 or 52 senators) is \Sexpr{100*sum(race.senate.result==25)/N + 100*sum(race.senate.result==26)/N}\%
  \item the probability that Republicans have a majority less than 53 (50, 51 or 52 senators) is \Sexpr{100*sum(race.senate.result==22)/N + 100*sum(race.senate.result==23)/N + 100*sum(race.senate.result==24)/N}\%
  \item the probability that the Republicans have a majority of 53 and more is \Sexpr{100*sum(race.senate.result<22)/N}\%
\end{itemize}

This also means that the probability that the Democrats win the Senate is \Sexpr{100*sum(race.senate.result>24)/N}\%.

\newthought{House question}. The Democrats now have 197 seats in the House.The simulation (\ref{subsec:house_micro_macro}) with a moderate +5\% upgrade gives a mean of 230 seats. The probabilities are:

<<echo=FALSE>>=
p1 <- 100*sum(race.result.House.combi>=230)/N
p2 <- 0
for (i in (218:229)) {
  p2 <- p2 + 100*sum(race.result.House.combi==i)/N
}
p3 <- 0
for (i in (206:217)) {
  p3 <- p3 + 100*sum(race.result.House.combi==i)/N
}
p4 <- 100*sum(race.result.House.combi<=205)/N
@

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p1}\%
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p2}\%
    \item Republican Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p4}\%
    \item Republican Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p3}\%
  \end{itemize}

This also means that the probability that the Democrats win the House is \Sexpr{p1+p2}\%. For the main question I put it at 75\%.

\newthought{Main question}.  Based on what I found out\sidenote{see ''Conditional Probabilities and Likelihood Ratios"} I recalculated the matrix. It is now given by Figure~\ref{fig:main1}.

Starting from the data per state, the micro-simulation indicates that the Democrats are likely to \emph{win} 22 seats, getting them to 215. That is very close to 218 in order to win the House with a probability of \Sexpr{round(prob.House*100,2)}\%.

\newthought{Combining micro and macro}.

p1 <- 100*sum(race.result.House.combi>=230)/N
p2 <- 0
for (i in (218:229)) {
  p2 <- p2 + 100*sum(race.result.House.combi==i)/N
}
p3 <- 0
for (i in (206:217)) {
  p3 <- p3 + 100*sum(race.result.House.combi==i)/N
}
p4 <- 100*sum(race.result.House.combi<=205)/N
@

The simulation with a moderate +3\% upgrade gives a mean of \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.combi),0)} seats. The probabilities are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p1}\%
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p2}\%
    \item Republican Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p4}\%
    \item Republican Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p3}\%
\end{itemize}

This also means that the probability that the Democrats win the House is \Sexpr{p1+p2}\%. 

\newthought{This calculation} shows that the result for the House elections is very volatile with regard to the degree of interconnectedness: an upgrade of 3\% shifts the mean number of seats for the Democrats from 215 to 227 (+5.6\%), almost the double of the upgrade! The standard deviation is the same for the result of the micro simulation and the result of the combined simulation ($\sigma=5.61$). Because of this volatility I reduce the effect of the upgrade to a maximum rise of the mean number of seats to the level of the upgrade itself. In this case: an upgrade of 3\% can only lead to 221=215*1.03 seats. The standard deviation is kept at 5.61. This gives the following estimates:

<<echo=FALSE>>=
mu <- 221
sigma <- 5.61
q1 <- round(100*(1 - pnorm(230, mu, sigma)),2)
q2 <- round(100*(pnorm(230, mu, sigma) - pnorm(218, mu, sigma)),2)
q3 <- round(100*(pnorm(218, mu, sigma) - pnorm(205, mu, sigma)),2)
q4 <- round(100*pnorm(205, mu, sigma),2)
@

The probabilities are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q1}\%
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q2}\%
    \item Republican Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q4}\%
    \item Republican Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q3}\%
\end{itemize}

This  means that the probability that the Democrats win the House is \Sexpr{q1+q2}\% and this is the value I use for the general question.

\newthought{The Weekly Standard} now has an election model\sidenote{https://www.weeklystandard.com/swingseat-senate-election-model/} for the Senate. The methodology is explained, however not into great detail. They also use the judgements by Cook, Sabato and Inside Elections, but the results are quiet different. For example: they put the chance of a Democratic win of the Senate on 31.5\%. My calculations still do not give them any chance at all.

\end{itemize}

This also means that the probability that the Democrats win the House is \Sexpr{p1+p2}\%. 

\newthought{Again this calculation} shows that the result for the House elections is very volatile with regard to the degree of interconnectedness: an upgrade of 3\% shifts the mean number of seats for the Democrats from \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.micro),0)} to \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.combi),0)} (\Sexpr{round(100*(mean(race.result.House.combi)- mean(race.result.House.micro))/mean(race.result.House.micro),2)}\%)! The standard deviation is the same for the result of the micro simulation and the result of the combined simulation ($\sigma=$ \Sexpr{round(sd(race.result.House.combi),3)}). Because of this volatility I reduce the effect of the upgrade to a maximum rise of the mean number of seats to the level of the upgrade itself. In this case: an upgrade of 3\% can only lead to \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.micro)*1.03,0)} seats. The standard deviation is kept at \Sexpr{round(sd(race.result.House.combi),3)}. This gives the following estimates:

<<echo=FALSE>>=
mu <- mean(race.result.House.micro)*1.03
sigma <- sd(race.result.House.combi)
q1 <- round(100*(1 - pnorm(230, mu, sigma)),2)
q2 <- round(100*(pnorm(230, mu, sigma) - pnorm(218, mu, sigma)),2)
q3 <- round(100*(pnorm(218, mu, sigma) - pnorm(205, mu, sigma)),2)
q4 <- round(100*pnorm(205, mu, sigma),2)
@

The probabilities are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q1}\%
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q2}\%
    \item Republican Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q4}\%
    \item Republican Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q3}\%
\end{itemize}

This  means that the probability that the Democrats win the House is \Sexpr{q1+q2}\% and this is the value I use for the general question.

In this micro simulation the Democrats win on average \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.Senate.micro),0)} seats (Figure~\ref{fig:senatesim02jul}). The probability of the Democrats winning the senate is \Sexpr{round(100*prob,0)}\%.

There is strong agreement between Cook and Sabato. Inside Elections show a shift from ''Likely Democrat" towards ''Toss up". We can compare the opinions of these raters with the results of recent polls\sidenote{https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-may-have-a-narrow-senate-advantage/}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Ohio: Brown has a double digit lead in the polls. Cook and Inside Elections position this state as ''Lean Democrat". On the basis of the polls I change the settings in Cook and Inside Elections to ''Likely Democrat"
  \item Pennsylvania: also double digit lead in the pool for Casey. No adjustment is needed because all raters have this state as eiter ''Likely D" or ''Solid D"
  \item Montana: Tester leads 51/44. Sabato has this state as ''Lean D" and Inside Elections as ''Tilt D" (which I group with ''Toss-up"). On the basis of the polls I upgrade Montana in Sabato and Inside Elections to ''Likely D"
  \item West-Virginia: Manchin leads 48/39. All raters have this state as ''Toss-up". Upgrade to ''Likely D"
  \item Wisconsin: Baldwin leads 49/40. Inside Elections have this state as ''Tilt D". Upgrade to ''Likely D"
  \item Florida and North-Dacota: polls say ''Toss-up" and all raters do the same. No change

The micro simulation with the revised ratings on the basis of the polling results indicate that the Democrats get on average \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.Senate.micro),0)} seats, which is only 1 seat more than with the unrevised ratings (Figure~\ref{fig:senatesim02julb}).

Starting from the data per state, the micro-simulation indicates that the Democrats are likely to \emph{win} \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.micro - 195),0)} extra seats (Figure~\ref{fig:housesim5}), getting them to \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.micro),0)}.

The  simulation (with the revised ratings on the basis of the polling results) and with a moderate +3\% upgrade shows that the Democrats get on average \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.Senate.combi),0)} seats. The probability of the Democrats winning the senate is still negligible: \Sexpr{round((p1+p2),0)}\%.

The probabilities for the Good Judgement question are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 53 or more senators. Probability=\Sexpr{p1}\%
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 53 senators. Probability=\Sexpr{p2}\%
    \item Republican Party, with 53 or more senators. Probability=\Sexpr{p4}\%
    \item Republican Party, with less than 53 senators. Probability=\Sexpr{p3}\%
\end{itemize}

The reasons that make it so difficult for the Democrats to win the Senate are unchanged: they have to defend 26 seats while the Republicans just a third (9) of that number. Even if all the 26 Democratic seats were safe (which they are not), they would still need to take 2 seats from the 9 Republican incumbents. The Democrat's biggest opportunities are in Arizona and Nevada. In Arizona we will have to wait until the Republican primary on August 28th to see who will be running on the Republican side. In Nevada, the most recent polls still show that Heller and Rosen have the same support. There are at the moment no signs that these states move significantly towards the Democrats.

@

The simulation with a moderate +3\% upgrade gives a mean of \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.combi),0)} seats. The probabilities are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p1}\%
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p2}\%
    \item Republican Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p4}\%
    \item Republican Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p3}\%
\end{itemize}

This also means that the probability that the Democrats win the House is \Sexpr{p1+p2}\%. 

\newthought{Again this calculation} shows that the result for the House elections is very volatile with regard to the degree of interconnectedness: an upgrade of 3\% shifts the mean number of seats for the Democrats from \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.micro),0)} (a gain of \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.micro),0)-193}) to \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.combi),0)} (a gain of \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.combi),0)-193} or +\Sexpr{round(100*(mean(race.result.House.combi)- mean(race.result.House.micro))/mean(race.result.House.micro),2)}\%)! 

In \ref{subsec:macrohouse} we constructed a linear model linking the president's approval rate (Gallup) with the number of House-seats gained or lost. For first time presidents the relation is given by:

\begin{equation}
  y = -140.5292 + 2.2224*x
\end{equation}

At the moment the approval rate of the president is 42\% which predicts that the Republicans could lose \Sexpr{round(-140.5292 + 2.2224*42,0)} seats. The 95\% confidence interval is [\Sexpr{round(-140.5292 + 2.2224*42 +15,0)},\Sexpr{round(-140.5292 + 2.2224*42 -15,0)}]. Our upgrade model for the House (+3\%) does not seem excessive because it predicts a loss for the Republicans of -\Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.combi),0)-193} which is at the low edge of the confidence interval.

The degree of volatility is still high so I still limit the upgrade effect to a maximum rise of the mean number of seats to the level of the upgrade itself. In this case: an upgrade of 3\% can only lead to \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.micro)*1.03,0)} seats. The standard deviation is kept at \Sexpr{round(sd(race.result.House.combi),3)}. With these assumptions I get the following probabilities:

<<echo=FALSE>>=
mu <- mean(race.result.House.micro)*1.03
sigma <- sd(race.result.House.combi)
q1 <- round(100*(1 - pnorm(230, mu, sigma)),2)
q2 <- round(100*(pnorm(230, mu, sigma) - pnorm(218, mu, sigma)),2)
q3 <- round(100*(pnorm(218, mu, sigma) - pnorm(205, mu, sigma)),2)
q4 <- round(100*pnorm(205, mu, sigma),2)
@

The probabilities are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q1}\%
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q2}\%
    \item Republican Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q4}\%
    \item Republican Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q3}\%
\end{itemize}

This  means that the probability that the Democrats win the House is \Sexpr{q1+q2}\% and this is the value I use for the general question.

In this micro simulation the Democrats win on average \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.Senate.micro),0)} seats (Figure~\ref{fig:senatesim02jul}). The probability of the Democrats winning the senate is \Sexpr{round(100*prob,0)}\%.

There is strong agreement between all three forecasters.

The  simulation (with the revised ratings on the basis of the polling results) and with a moderate +3\% upgrade shows that the Democrats get on average \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.Senate.combi),0)} seats. The probability of the Democrats winning the senate is still negligible: \Sexpr{round((p1+p2),0)}\%.

The probabilities for the Good Judgement question are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 53 or more senators. Probability=\Sexpr{p1}\%
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 53 senators. Probability=\Sexpr{p2}\%
    \item Republican Party, with 53 or more senators. Probability=\Sexpr{p4}\%
    \item Republican Party, with less than 53 senators. Probability=\Sexpr{p3}\%
\end{itemize}

The reasons that make it so difficult for the Democrats to win the Senate are unchanged: they have to defend 26 seats while the Republicans just a third (9) of that number. Even if all the 26 Democratic seats were safe (which they are not), they would still need to take 2 seats from the 9 Republican incumbents. The Democrat's biggest opportunities are in Arizona and Nevada. In Arizona we will have to wait until the Republican primary on August 28th to see who will be running on the Republican side. In Nevada, the most recent polls still show that Heller and Rosen have the same support. There are at the moment no signs that these states move significantly towards the Democrats.

House$DemProbCor <- ifelse((House$DemProb + 0.03) > 1, 0.999, (House$DemProb + 0.03))

  p3 <- p3 + 100*sum(race.result.House.combi==i)/N
}
p4 <- 100*sum(race.result.House.combi<=205)/N
@

The simulation with a moderate +3\% upgrade gives a mean of \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.combi),0)} seats. The probabilities are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p1}\%
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p2}\%
    \item Republican Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p4}\%
    \item Republican Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{p3}\%
\end{itemize}

This also means that the probability that the Democrats win the House is \Sexpr{p1+p2}\%. 

\newthought{Again this calculation} shows that the result for the House elections is very volatile with regard to the degree of interconnectedness: an upgrade of 3\% shifts the mean number of seats for the Democrats from \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.micro),0)} (a gain of \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.micro),0)-193}) to \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.combi),0)} (a gain of \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.combi),0)-193} or +\Sexpr{round(100*(mean(race.result.House.combi)- mean(race.result.House.micro))/mean(race.result.House.micro),2)}\%)! 

In \ref{subsec:macrohouse} we constructed a linear model linking the president's approval rate (Gallup) with the number of House-seats gained or lost. For first time presidents the relation is given by:

\begin{equation}
  y = -140.5292 + 2.2224*x
\end{equation}

At the moment the approval rate of the president is 42\% which predicts that the Republicans could lose \Sexpr{round(-140.5292 + 2.2224*42,0)} seats. The 95\% confidence interval is [\Sexpr{round(-140.5292 + 2.2224*42 +15,0)},\Sexpr{round(-140.5292 + 2.2224*42 -15,0)}]. Our upgrade model for the House (+3\%) does not seem excessive because it predicts a loss for the Republicans of -\Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.combi),0)-193} which is at the low edge of the confidence interval.

The degree of volatility is still high so I still limit the upgrade effect to a maximum rise of the mean number of seats to the level of the upgrade itself. In this case: an upgrade of 3\% can only lead to \Sexpr{round(mean(race.result.House.micro)*1.03,0)} seats. The standard deviation is kept at \Sexpr{round(sd(race.result.House.combi),3)}. With these assumptions I get the following probabilities:

<<echo=FALSE>>=
mu <- mean(race.result.House.micro)*1.03
sigma <- sd(race.result.House.combi)
q1 <- round(100*(1 - pnorm(230, mu, sigma)),2)
q2 <- round(100*(pnorm(230, mu, sigma) - pnorm(218, mu, sigma)),2)
q3 <- round(100*(pnorm(218, mu, sigma) - pnorm(205, mu, sigma)),2)
q4 <- round(100*pnorm(205, mu, sigma),2)
@

The probabilities are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q1}\%
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q2}\%
    \item Republican Party, with 230 or more representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q4}\%
    \item Republican Party, with less than 230 representatives. Probability=\Sexpr{q3}\%
\end{itemize}

This  means that the probability that the Democrats win the House is \Sexpr{q1+q2}\% and this is the value I use for the general question.

\section{2018-08-20}

After release of 538 House election model(s). I digitized the bar graph from the 538 ''Classic" model.

  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{USC-HouseC1}

\label{fig:HouseC1}

\end{marginfigure}

Some checks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item total probability that the Democrats win the House: 538 (23.08.2018)=71,6\% - digitized=$\Sexpr{round(100*sum(House_Classic$Prob[House_Classic$Rep.seats<218]),2)}$\%
  \item probability that the Democrats win more than 55 seats. That would bring their total to more than 250 and the Republicans to less than 185): 538 (23.08.2018)=10\% - digitized=$\Sexpr{round(100*sum(House_Classic$Prob[House_Classic$Rep.seats<185]),2)}$\%
  \item probability that the Democrats win 13 to 55 seats (or Republicans 185 to 2227): 538 (23.08.2018)=80\% - digitized=$\Sexpr{round(100*sum(House_Classic$Prob[House_Classic$Rep.seats>184 & House_Classic$Rep.seats<228]),2)}$\%
  \item probability that the Democrats win less than 13  (or Republicans more than 227): 538 (23.08.2018)=10\% - digitized=$\Sexpr{round(100*sum(House_Classic$Prob[House_Classic$Rep.seats>227]),2)}$\%
\end{itemize}

The digitisation is more or less OK.

The remarkable thing is that the plot is not symmetrical: it has a long tail on the left side (fewer Republican seats). What is going on?
\begin{itemize}
  \item For the Democrats the number of ''Safe/Solid" seats is 191. According to 538 the minimum seats they gain is 187. In the worst case the Democrats keep about the number of ''Safe" seats
  \item For the Repbulicans the number of ''Safe/Solid" seats is 137. According to 538 the minimum seats they gain is 146. In the worst case the Republicans have a little more than their ''Safe" seats
  \item That means that the competition is for the 98 remaining seats which are dubbed ''Likely", ''Lean", ''Tilt" or ''Toss-up".
  \item There are 69 Republican seats ''Likely/Lean/Tilt" and only 23 Democratic seats. As we can see from the boxplots in Figur~\ref{fig:HouseCpopvote} there is no big difference in the estimate of the populare vote between Democrats and Republicans in the categories ''Likely" and ''Lean".

538 does its simulations for each district and not for the large groups ''Safe", ''Likely", ''Lean" etc. Furthermore they do not only take into account the polls of the popular vote, but also the fundraising capability of the candidate. A comparision of my prognosis and the simulation by 538 of the House election:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Democratic Party, with 230 or more representatives. My prognosis =\Sexpr{q1}\%. 538=\Sexpr{round(100*sum(House_Classic$Prob[House_Classic$Rep.seats<205]),2)}\%
    \item Democratic Party, with less than 230 representatives. My prognosis=\Sexpr{q2}\%. 538=\Sexpr{round(100*sum(House_Classic$Prob[House_Classic$Rep.seats>204 & House_Classic$Rep.seats<218]),2)}\%
    \item Republican Party, with 230 or more representatives. My prognosis=\Sexpr{q4}\%. 538=\Sexpr{round(100*sum(House_Classic$Prob[House_Classic$Rep.seats>229]),2)}\%
    \item Republican Party, with less than 230 representatives. My prognosis=\Sexpr{q3}\%. 538=\Sexpr{round(100*sum(House_Classic$Prob[House_Classic$Rep.seats>217 & House_Classic$Rep.seats<229]),2)}\%
\end{itemize}
